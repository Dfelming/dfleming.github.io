            <h1>Making the Hot Cocoa</h1>
            <p>
                To start, you’ll need a mix of whole or 2% milk, heavy cream, 
                and evaporated milk to create the perfect creamy base. This 
                combination gives the hot cocoa a rich, luxurious texture that 
                feels like a hug in a mug. Heat the mixture gently in a 
                saucepan, being careful not to let it boil. Stir in cocoa 
                powder and sugar, whisking until the cocoa dissolves completely 
                and the mixture is smooth. You can also just use white sugar 
                but I prefer brown sugar for the extra depth of flavor. Adding 
                a few pieces of high-quality chocolate can take the richness 
                to the next level, creating a silky, almost decadent cocoa. 
                It also thickens up the hot cocoa like the Parisian hot cocoa 
                that took social media by storm. There’s nothing worse than 
                watery hot cocoa. And finally, a pinch of salt is a small but 
                important addition to enhance the flavors, and a splash of 
                vanilla extract at the end gives the drink a warm, fragrant 
                finish.
            </p>
                If you’re feeling adventurous, try infusing your milk mixture 
                with whole spices like cinnamon sticks, cloves, or even a 
                split vanilla bean for a subtle yet aromatic twist. Simply add 
                the spices at the beginning and strain them out before serving.
