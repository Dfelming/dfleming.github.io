        <h2>Making the Hot Cocoa</h2>
            <p>
                To start, you’ll need a mix of whole or 2% milk, heavy cream, 
                and evaporated milk to create the perfect creamy base. This 
                combination gives the hot cocoa a rich, luxurious texture that 
                feels like a hug in a mug. Heat the mixture gently in a 
                saucepan, being careful not to let it boil. Stir in cocoa 
                powder and sugar, whisking until the cocoa dissolves completely 
                and the mixture is smooth. You can also just use white sugar 
                but I prefer brown sugar for the extra depth of flavor. Adding 
                a few pieces of high-quality chocolate can take the richness 
                to the next level, creating a silky, almost decadent cocoa. 
                It also thickens up the hot cocoa like the Parisian hot cocoa 
                that took social media by storm. There’s nothing worse than 
                watery hot cocoa. And finally, a pinch of salt is a small but 
                important addition to enhance the flavors, and a splash of 
                vanilla extract at the end gives the drink a warm, fragrant 
                finish.
            </p>
                If you’re feeling adventurous, try infusing your milk mixture 
                with whole spices like cinnamon sticks, cloves, or even a 
                split vanilla bean for a subtle yet aromatic twist. Simply add 
                the spices at the beginning and strain them out before serving.
         <h2>Preparing the Marshmallow Topping</h2>
             <p>
                The marshmallow topping is what makes this drink truly special. 
                Start by adding egg whites and a pinch of cream of tartar to a 
                bowl. Use a mixer to beat the egg whites until they’re bubbly, 
                foamy, and just starting to hold soft peaks. This step helps 
                stabilize the mixture and sets the stage for the sugar syrup.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. Heat over 
                medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Once 
                the sugar is fully dissolved, stop stirring to prevent 
                crystallization, and let the mixture simmer until it reaches 
                around 240°F. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, you can 
                test it by dropping a little syrup into a glass of cold water; 
                it should form a soft, pliable ball when ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                With your mixer running on medium speed, carefully and slowly 
                stream the hot syrup into the whipped egg whites. It’s 
                important to pour the syrup in a steady, thin stream to avoid 
                scrambling the eggs. Once all the syrup is added, increase the 
                speed and whip until the marshmallow is glossy, thick, and 
                holds stiff peaks. The result should be a fluffy, spreadable 
                topping that’s perfect for piping.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’d like to get creative, you can flavor the marshmallow 
                with a splash of peppermint for a hot cocoa variation. You 
                could also flavor the hot cocoa with peppermint instead and 
                leave the marshmallow topping as is.  
            </p>
        <h2>Assembling and Toasting</h2>
            <p>
                Once your hot cocoa is ready and poured into mugs, it’s time to 
                decorate! Transfer the marshmallow topping into a piping bag 
                fitted with a decorative tip, or use a plastic bag with the 
                corner snipped off if you’re in a pinch. Pipe the marshmallow 
                around the rim of each mug, creating swirls, peaks, or any 
                design that speaks to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                To toast the marshmallow, use a kitchen torch to carefully 
                caramelize the topping until it’s golden brown with slightly 
                crisp edges. This step adds a delightful smoky sweetness that 
                elevates the entire drink. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For extra flair, sprinkle crushed graham crackers, chocolate 
                shavings, or a dusting of cocoa powder over the toasted 
                marshmallow. These little touches make it feel extra special 
                and customizable for guests.
            </p>
        <h2>Variations and Customizations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Flavored Hot Cocoa:</b> Try stirring in a bit of caramel 
                    sauce, peppermint, or even cinnamon for a spiced hot cocoa.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alternative Toppings:</b> If marshmallow isn’t your thing
                    , swap it out for whipped cream or no topping at all! You 
                    could also turn it into a tiramisu hot cocoa by making a 
                    cream foam with mascarpone, heavy cream, vanilla extract, 
                    and simple syrup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cold Cocoa:</b> Turn this into a summer treat by letting 
                    the hot cocoa cool, adding ice, and topping with cold, 
                    whipped marshmallow. You could also blend it with ice to 
                    make a frozen hot cocoa!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Make-Ahead and Leftovers</h2>
                <p>
                    The hot cocoa can be made ahead of time and stored in the 
                    fridge for up to two days. Simply reheat it gently on the 
                    stovetop or in the microwave when you’re ready to serve. 
                    The marshmallow topping is best used fresh for that light 
                    and fluffy texture, but if you have leftovers, store them 
                    in an airtight container at room temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leftover marshmallow topping is incredibly versatile! Use 
                    it as a dip for fruit, graham crackers, or cookies, or 
                    spread it over brownies or cupcakes for a quick and fun 
                    dessert. If you have leftover hot cocoa, freeze it into 
                    popsicle molds for a frozen treat or use it as a base for 
                    chocolate milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hot cocoa with torched marshmallow topping is more 
                    than just a drink—it’s an experience. From the rich, creamy 
                    cocoa to the golden, fluffy topping, every sip feels 
                    indulgent and comforting. Perfect for cozy nights at home, 
                    festive gatherings, or whenever you want to treat yourself 
                    to something special!

                    MAKE THE MARSHMALLOW FLUFF
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            In a mixing bowl, add egg whites and cream of 
                            tartar. Whisk until the mixture becomes bubbly and 
                            foamy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. 
                        Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar 
                        dissolves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow the mixture to simmer without stirring further, 
                        until it reaches about 240°F or 115°C using a candy 
                        thermometer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the mixer running at medium speed, slowly stream 
                        the hot syrup into the egg whites. Avoid pouring too 
                        quickly to prevent scrambling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once all the syrup is added, increase the mixer speed 
                        to high and beat until the mixture is glossy and holds 
                        stiff peaks.
